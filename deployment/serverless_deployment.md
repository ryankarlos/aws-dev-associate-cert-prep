## SAM

The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless 
applications on AWS.

A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work 
together to perform tasks. Note that a serverless application is more than just a Lambda functionâ€”it can include 
additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings.

You can use AWS SAM to define your serverless applications.

An AWS SAM template file closely follows the format of an AWS CloudFormation template file, which is described in Template anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. The primary differences between AWS SAM template files and AWS CloudFormation template files are the following:

**Transform declaration** The declaration Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 is required for AWS SAM template files. This declaration identifies an AWS CloudFormation template file as an AWS SAM template file. For more information about transforms, see Transform in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
**Globals section** The Globals section is unique to AWS SAM. It defines properties that are common to all your serverless functions and APIs. All the AWS::Serverless::Function, AWS::Serverless::Api, and AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable resources inherit the properties that are defined in the Globals section. For more information about this section, see Globals section of the AWS SAM template.
**Resources section** In AWS SAM templates the Resources section can contain a combination of AWS CloudFormation resources and AWS SAM resources. For more information about AWS CloudFormation resources, see AWS resource and property types reference in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. For more information about AWS SAM resources, see AWS SAM resource and property reference.
**Parameters section** Objects that are declared in the Parameters section cause the sam deploy --guided command to present additional prompts to the user. For examples of declared objects and the corresponding prompts, see sam deploy in the AWS SAM CLI command reference.

All other sections of an AWS SAM template file correspond to the AWS CloudFormation template file section of the same name.
